<!-- MAIN CONTENT -->

    <h2 class="strike">This platform exists to restore fairness in a system where fear, confusion and imbalance too often rule.</h2>

    <p>Welcome to Your Debt Support Hub. Over the past five years, personal debt in the UK has risen sharply — not because people were reckless, but because many were caught in circumstances beyond their control.</p>

    <h2>What Happened?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Lockdown and Furlough (2020):</strong> Millions were placed on furlough at 80% salary. Spending dropped, but bills did not.</li>
        <li><strong>Energy Crisis (2021–2022):</strong> Supplier collapses and soaring tariffs trapped households, especially those unable to switch providers.</li>
        <li><strong>Cost-of-Living Pressures:</strong> Inflation surged, wages stagnated, and essentials became more expensive — forcing many to rely on credit.</li>
        <li><strong>Financial Institutions’ Role:</strong> Borrowing was pushed heavily post-lockdown. When repayments faltered, debts were sold to agencies prioritising profit, not fairness.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Reality in Numbers</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Household Debt-to-Income Ratio:</strong> By mid-2025, households owed 117% of their disposable income.</li>
        <li><strong>Consumer Credit:</strong> After early 2020 repayments, borrowing grew again by 2024 — mainly from credit cards and loans.</li>
        <li><strong>Energy Arrears:</strong> Millions accumulated debts during the 2022 crisis, often unable to clear them before switching suppliers.</li>
        <li><strong>Insolvencies:</strong> 30,494 individual insolvencies in Q2 2025 — a sign of systemic strain, not personal failure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Our Promise</h2>
    <p>This site offers free, unbiased, and non-judgmental advice. We understand debt isn’t about luxury — it’s about survival in a system that failed many. Our goal is to help you understand your rights, challenge unfair practices, and regain control with clarity and confidence.</p>

    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>A victim is a victim — financial, legal, medical or emotional. Justice should never depend on a person's bank balance, especially when hardship was caused by events outside their control.</p>
    <p>We are not solicitors, nor do we claim to be. We aim to create awareness and self-empowerment so you can take back control with confidence and dignity.</p>
